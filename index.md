# Welcome to My Website

Currently pursuing a PhD at the Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences (LSCE) at Université Paris-Saclay, south of Paris, my research focuses on polar atmosphere modeling under the supervision of Cécile Agosta, within Amaelle Landais' team. A particular interest lies in modeling isotopic variability in Antarctica.

I graduated from the École Normale Supérieure de Paris-Saclay and hold a master's degree in Geosciences from the École Normale Supérieure in Paris.

Beyond research, science communication is a key passion. Co-founding the popular science channel Ordres de grandeur (Instagram, TikTok) has provided a platform to explore orders of magnitude—those staggering contrasts between the infinitely large and the infinitely small that shape our understanding of the world.
